If you've met one degen, you've met one degen. 
To wit, no 2 degens are alike. 
We all have different roles, dreams, and goals. 
We share a mostly optimistic vision for the future.
We differ in opinions, but remain a united front for this vision. 
The future depends on each one of us, right now, to shill this cause. 
Don't slow your role. 
Never give up. 
Own your degen, spirit and soul.
